*DESCRIPTION* : The WeatherAPIClient.java is a Java-based REST API client developed to fetch real-time weather data from an external weather service API. The objective of this task was to implement a client that sends HTTP requests to the API endpoint, retrieves weather information based on a given city or location, and processes the JSON response to display user-friendly weather details.

This task primarily involved working with Javaâ€™s HTTP libraries to make GET requests and handle responses. The response, returned in JSON format, was parsed using appropriate JSON parsing libraries (such as org.json or Gson) to extract essential data like temperature, humidity, weather conditions, wind speed, and location information.

The application handles error scenarios gracefully, such as network issues, invalid city names, or API key errors. Proper exception handling ensures the robustness of the client. Eclipse IDE was used for writing, testing, and debugging the Java code efficiently.

This client can be integrated into a larger application or used standalone for command-line-based weather updates. It demonstrates how to work with RESTful APIs in Java, handle HTTP communication, and parse external data sources.

Key Features:
Connects to a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI).

Sends HTTP GET requests with query parameters (e.g., city name and API key).

Parses JSON responses to extract and display key weather information.

Implements exception handling for failed or invalid requests.

Clean and modular code structure for reusability and integration.

Tools and Technologies Used:
IDE: Eclipse

Programming Language: Java

HTTP Client: java.net.HttpURLConnection or HttpClient (depending on implementation)

JSON Parsing: org.json / Gson / Jackson (whichever you used)

REST API: External Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

Data Format: JSON

*OUTPUT* :

Weather in Mumbai: clear sky
